# Theme-Aware Blobs for Background Personality

Every portfolio site has a “background.” Most are boring gradients. I wanted something alive but not distracting — so I landed on SVG blobs that wiggle, float, and even shift colors when I toggle dark mode.

  Your background should add personality without pulling focus from the content.

## Setup

- I grabbed a few blob SVGs from Blobmaker (online generator).
- Dropped them into `motion.div` with scroll transforms.
- Applied `currentColor` so they adapt instantly to theme changes.

With a light theme, they’re pastel and airy. In dark mode, they deepen into moody purples and blues. Tiny detail, but it really changes the vibe.

## Challenges

Performance. I noticed flickering when blobs moved too fast, so I throttled their scroll speed and randomized size instead. Also had to balance contrast — blobs that were too dark made text unreadable.

## Takeaways

Little touches like this make a site feel crafted. It’s subtle, but users notice when a site “breathes.”
