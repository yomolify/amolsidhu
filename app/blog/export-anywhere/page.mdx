# Export Components to PNG with Style

This was one of those “small feature, big wow” moments. I added an export button to my charts, and suddenly everyone thought it was a “real product.” People love pressing buttons that give them files.

  Exporting makes your demo feel less like a toy and more like a tool.

## Setup

- Used `html2canvas` to screenshot a `ref`.
- Converted the canvas to a PNG blob.
- Triggered download with a simple anchor click.

Took maybe 15 minutes, but the perceived value? Way higher.

## Challenges

Light mode exports were a bit dim. I fixed it by forcing a white background layer during rendering. Small thing, big difference.

## Takeaways

If you’re demoing data, add an export button. It’s a credibility multiplier — users immediately see it as shareable, useful, and legit.
