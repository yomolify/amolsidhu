# Drag & Drop That Just Feels Right

I’ve built plenty of “demo” drag-and-drops, but they always felt… cheap. The card jumps, the drop zones don’t line up, and the whole thing screams _unfinished_. This time I wanted a board that felt closer to Trello — buttery smooth and satisfying.

<Callout type="note">
  Drag & drop is one of those UX details you don’t notice until it’s wrong.
</Callout>

## Setup

- I used `@dnd-kit/core` for sensors and collisions.
- Wrapped my columns in `SortableContext`.
- Layered in Framer Motion so items eased into place instead of teleporting.

Once I added spring animations, the whole thing just clicked. Cards didn’t just move — they _glided_.

## Challenges

I kept it simple and stuck with `closestCenter` for collision detection — it felt good enough for this demo, and I didn’t run into anything major that needed tweaking.

## Takeaways

If you want users to _trust_ your UI, polish the details. A smooth drag interaction doesn’t just look good — it makes the whole app feel reliable.
