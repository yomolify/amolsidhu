# Parallax Magic in Framer Motion

When I first started tinkering with scroll effects, everything either felt too subtle (like… why bother) or way too heavy (janky scroll + fans going brrrr). Framer Motion’s `useScroll` and `useTransform` ended up being my sweet spot — smooth on GPU, predictable in code, and honestly fun to play with.

  cinematic.
</Callout>

## Setup

- Wrap sections in `motion.div`.
- Use `useScroll` to grab a scroll progress value.
- Map it into transforms with `useTransform`.

I usually layer 2–3 elements with different speeds. For example, a background image might move at 10%, a mid-layer card at 40%, and a floating headline at 80%. The trick is to keep it consistent — otherwise your user’s eyes get confused instead of guided.

## Challenges

One thing I hit: flickering on fast scrolls. That happened because my transforms were pushing layers outside their container too aggressively. The fix was just to cap the transforms within a reasonable range and avoid using box-shadows on GPU-transformed elements (shadows don’t always play nice).

## Takeaways

This effect feels like a cheap cheat code: minimal code, big payoff. It’s now a recurring motif in my builds — scroll, reveal, depth, done.
