# Data-Driven UI with Just JSON

This one came from laziness, honestly. I didn’t want to hardcode sections, copy-paste props, or touch JSX just to add a new card. So I asked: what if the whole UI was driven by a JSON config?

<Callout type="note">
  If you’re repeating yourself, you’re probably one `map()` away from freedom.
</Callout>

## Setup

- Defined a `sections.json` with titles, text, and types.
- Wrote a renderer that mapped over it into cards.
- Added optional fields for icons, links, etc.

Now adding a section is literally editing JSON. Want a new feature card? Add an object. No rebuild needed.

## Challenges

The hardest part wasn’t code — it was deciding _how flexible_ the JSON should be. Too rigid, and I’d still need JSX tweaks. Too flexible, and it’s basically a CMS. I aimed for “enough” — just enough keys to cover 80% of my needs.

## Takeaways

This pattern makes your code feel like Lego. It’s modular, fast to iterate, and surprisingly powerful for demos.
